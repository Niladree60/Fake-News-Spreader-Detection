This is my masters thesis, here I proposed a framework to detect the fake news spreaders on social media. Extracted statistical feature and used extensive preprocessing techniques with the ensemble classifiers. The proposed framework helps law enforcement easily detect fake
news spreaders, ensuring safer social media platforms for all.
